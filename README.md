# Final-Project-CSS
The final project brings together all of the concepts that we have been working on this term in our assignments, class activities, and discussions. The overall idea is to design two different stylesheets for the same website that give it a completely different look and feel. I will be given a starter index.html file and, without editing any of the HTML, I will create two stylesheets that I can toggle between. Showcase your CSS skills!
